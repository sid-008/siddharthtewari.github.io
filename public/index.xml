      <description>A brief history of cloud computing and virtualisation The cloud has often been simply described as “someone else’s computer”. Back in the old days of yore, people would have to setup and manage their own hardware infrastructure and servers.&#xA;This was quite a hassle and also quite expensive. Cloud computing evolved as a solution to this issue. People no longer had to buy, maintain, manage or setup their own hardware. It worked out to be cheaper too, since people could pay only for the resources they used.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from the October Papers We Love meetup hosted by Madhav Jivrajani. The paper discussed was &amp;ldquo;Keep CALM and CRDT on!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;What is coordination &amp;ldquo;Knowledge is the dual of possibility&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s also message re-ordering, network partitions and all other flavours of why dist sys is hard. Other mechanisms like 2PC(2 phase commit) exist. coordination mechanisms are a way to sync access to a shared memory of some sort.</description>

      <title>How do you build a community?</title>

      <description>So what is a community? In one word? Its home. For me at least, Hackerspace PESU-ECC&amp;rsquo;s Mentor team, GDSC PESU-ECC &amp;lsquo;22 and ACM PESU-ECC had been my &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; for quite a while. The relentless memes. The insanely enlightening conversations. Learning from almost everyone there. The banter, the inside jokes, everything on that little whatsapp group was fun. It felt like &amp;ldquo;my people&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;d often call it home.&#xA;But how do you build such a community?</description>

      <title>What is a visionary?</title>

      <description>What is a visionary? When I was first asked this question in my CIE L1 course(A wonderful course offered by my university on entrepreneurship) it made me think. My immediate first thought was: Steve Jobs. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question of what a visionary person really is. This post is meant to be a reflection on this question.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve asked various people on their thoughts regarding this, along with the answers I listened to in class, most people tend to use words like &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ideas&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Matt Bucher Made helm, ex microsoft, kubernetes early days contributor great guy Definition of Serverless: Pattern in which the dev does not write a server process(sockets or daemons), entry point is an event handler Deus, open source competitor to heroku PaaS Explored kubernetes there, ms accquires deus, built AKS there Had to write new dockerfiles and images for diff images and OSs VMs big workhorse of the cloud Most functions as a service are built as a VM, supposed to be super fast, but was built on tech too bloated VM package the entire OS, serveral minutes to start Containers easier to use than VMs, dockerfiles good, dev exp for containers was great.</description>

      <description>Recently I had the chance to give a talk at the Razorpay office as a part of FOSS United Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s meetup. This was a full length talk and I had a great time talking to like minded people about this.&#xA;This itself is a pretty niche topic, but a lot of people aren&amp;rsquo;t really aware of the system-d feud, so I decided why not give a talk on it? The material I used for the talk is below.</description>

      <description>Setup A CRUD API or a Create-Read-Update-Delete API is one of the first steps you take in your journey exploring the world of backend development.&#xA;Get started with Golang by installing it on your computer if you haven’t already done so.&#xA;This tutorial will require some basic knowledge of golang.&#xA;Next we will install the packages needed for creating the CRUD API. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Gin Gonic to route the API endpoints.</description>

      <description>(This was originally published here, check out PESU-ECC&amp;rsquo;s MUNSOC site and show them some love!)&#xA;Iran Contra Affair The sale of arms to Iran, hostage exchanges(supposed), hezbollah and the civil war in Nicaragua. How are all these related? Well its a long story.&#xA;In simple terms; during the second Reagan term, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sales of weapons to Iran which at the time was under an arms embargo, and diverted the profits to the Contras, a group of anti-socialist rebels in Nicaragua that were opposed to the socialist Sandinista led government.</description>
