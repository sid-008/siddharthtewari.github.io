<p>When I was first asked this question in my CIE L1 course(A wonderful course offered by my university on entrepreneurship) it made me think. My immediate first thought was: Steve Jobs.
But it didn&rsquo;t answer the question of what a visionary person really is. This post is meant to be a reflection on this question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked various people on their thoughts regarding this, along with the answers I listened to in class, most people tend to use words like
&ldquo;future&rdquo;, &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;, &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;. But that didn&rsquo;t really make sense to me. Anyone can be an ideas man, innovation may well be part of being a visionary,
but a video I watched by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJpU43NA0c&amp;t=542s">Mark Manson</a> on youtube defined what a visionary is to me at least in the most concise manner possible.</p>
<p>A correct Contrarian.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good and concise way to look at it in my opinion. In this day and age we have a lot of contrarians, now I don&rsquo;t mean the normal kind of contrarian here
I mean someone that thinks &ldquo;No this is not how the world is going to move forward&rdquo; and are <em>correct</em> about it. These are the people who have incredibly, incredibly different opinions
on how the future would look like, and are <em>correct</em> about it.</p>
<p>Being a contrarian is pretty easy. Being a correct one however, is not(in the broad context of the future that is).</p>
<p>It takes a lot for a person to be told by everyone that they&rsquo;re wrong about whatever idea they have but for them to stick to their guns even if
people keep telling them they are wrong or will fail in whatever &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; venture they&rsquo;re undertaking. It can get hard to be told by most people about it.</p>
<p>For a visionary to be successful, they&rsquo;ve got to also as explained by Mark that they have to <em>execute on it massively</em>. They&rsquo;re quite literally disagreeing with almost everyone
and putting their neck out this way and also quite literally putting their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;visionary&rdquo; in my opinion isn&rsquo;t just an ideas man, or an &ldquo;innovator&rdquo; those adjectives are just a small piece of the puzzle.
Also important to note is that these &ldquo;visionaries&rdquo; don&rsquo;t do it all by themselves. Often times they have a huge supporting cast thats equally every bit important as the visionary.
But pop culture generally tends to fixate on the myth of the eccentric visionary.</p>
