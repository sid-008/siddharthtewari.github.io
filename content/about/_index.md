Title: About me
---

### Hello there!

Hey, I'm Siddharth! I build things. I'm an Engineer, writer(when I feel like it), and in general, someone who likes to 
constantly learn about new things, no matter how random they might be.
Whenever I can, I also go for rides on my bike! (Its a honda h'ness cb350)

I am deeply passionate about Computer Science, databases, operating systems and systems engineering in general, feel free to [reach out](mailto:siddharthtewari14@gmail.com) if you're hiring in this field!

You can also find my [resume here](https://sidt008.vercel.app/SiddharthTewariCV.pdf).

### What is this place?

Well, its somewhere I keep my notes and write occasionally about tech and other topics.
You will find a few incomplete posts on the site, [this is a conscious choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).

This site is pretty much where I dump most of my thoughts while learning new things or while pondering about other random things.

In sum: These are where I keep my "working notes"
