### Hello there!

Hey, I'm Siddharth! I build things. I'm an Engineer, audiophile, biking enthustiast(I own a honda h'ness cb350).
I'm currently in the process of exploring various fields which are new to me and reading more in general.

I am deeply passionate about Computer Science, databases, operating systems and systems engineering in general, feel free to [reach out](mailto:siddharthtewari14@gmail.com) if you're hiring in this field!

In addition, I also have a dog, her name is Amber. Feel free to reach out for more dog pics.

### What is this place?

Well, its somewhere I keep my notes and write occasionally about tech and other topics.
You will find a few incomplete posts on the site, [this is a conscious choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).

This site is pretty much where I dump most of my thoughts while learning new things or while pondering about other random things.

In sum: These are where I keep my "working notes"
